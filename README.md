# Anagramma-MultiMap
Special usage of Collections: Map, MultiMap and Stream

Collect the words listed in an external file into a Map where the key is the anagram 
(in our case the letters of a word in alphabetical order) of the words the value is a List/Set of 
the ones having the same anagram.

The solution uses streams, Lambda expressions and a multilevel comparator for final printing style.

There are two solutions having minor differences: one is commented, can be used both... The result is the same.
